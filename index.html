    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>Hello, my name is Jared and I am a student at USC Aiken that has decided to major in Computer Science. 
       This is a major that I would take as soon as I graduated High School because I wanted to finish it as soon as I could so as to get into the work force faster.
       The class I am taking now is CSCI 225 and it is teaching us how to implement HTML 5 and will later show us CSS and JAVA.
       The class as of now has finished CSS and has just started the Java section of the course which I hope is not to hard.
       The amount of work has grown and the Quizzes are also growing much more difficult.
       I myself have had trouble with remembering all the terms but it is always good to know your teacher will provide aid when needed.
       This class is most likely the most simple CSCI class you can take because of the fact that HTML is involved.
       Just something other than the University would be that I love BBQ food from Duke's. <br>

            This assignment required all students in CSCI 225 to create our first web page with HTML. The only real skills we used was the base line of HTML, HEAD, Body, and h1 - h6.</li>
        <li>Assignment 1:
            This assignment had me use internal links to sections in my website as well as the use of a table to show our class schedule. <br>
            I myself added a video from YouTube so as to fill in the requirments on my homework.
